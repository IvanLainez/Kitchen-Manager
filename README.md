# Kitchen-Manager

This is going to be an app to manage ingredients for meals on the kitchen.
You can add ingredients that you have bought into the adp, and the app will keep track of all the ingredients you currently have at the moment.
You can add recipies into the app that will tell you what ingredients and how much of that ingredient you will need to cook the recipies.
Once you have a recipie saved you can ask the app if you have enough ingredients to cook it or if you need to buy something
If you are going to buy you can ask the app to generate a shopping list with the required ingredients for a specific dish.
You can add expiration dates on ingredients to see which ingredients you need to use first
